This is largely just the walking animation) \n\nThings I will not do are:\n\n- Animations\n- Scratch sprites (i.e. sprites that are built from the ground up)\n- Tilesets\n- Non-Pokemon style sprites.\n\nPrices are around:\n\n- $13.30 USD for a single sprite\n- $16.50 USD for an overworld pack, with an additional $3.50 USD added for a back battle sprite/specialty overworld sprites like surfing, fishing, biking, ect.\n\nHere is a showcase of some sprites that I can make, to give you an idea of my scope: https://imgur.com/a/4UVydvj\n\nIf you would like any other information, or you're interested in commissioning me for spritework, please DM me."}, {'user': 'makho#2067', 'message': 'Famicon AGS-001 - $40\nUnit is stock and unmodded. There\'s a little bit of dust under the frontlight. Has a new aftermarket battery (not one of my mod batteries). Works great, I just have like 10 SPs and this one is already a duplicate.\n\nBlack AGB-001 - $55\nUnit has Funnyplaying **V1** IPS Mod installed with brightness control (select + L/R). Works great except for the expected screen tearing. There is also a small black dot on the screen that I can\'t seem to get to go away (under the "E" in "GAME", look at the imgur album)\n\nSilver AGB-001 - $125\nUnit has aftermarket AGS-101 LCD installed with brightness control via the aurora ribbon mod (select + L/R to adjust brightness). Unit is rechargeable with 2000mAh (though it\'s been a few years so maybe less now) LiPo battery and Micro USB port. The machined aluminum shell is unfinished (i.e. no anodization or paint). It works fine as is but does show wear VERY easily and thus does already have quite a few scratches. It\'s usuable as-is, but I\'d recommend getting it painted or anodized. Has a new plastic lens. Most glass lenses don\'t seem to fit properly as the tolerances are a bit tight. Works great, I just don\'t like it.'}, {'user': 'makho#2067', 'message': 'WTS 1xAGS-001, 2xBacklit AGBs, 1xOXY-001 and 2xO3DS, Prices include CONUS shipping.
