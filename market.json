Unit is rechargeable with 2000mAh (though it's been a few years so maybe less now) LiPo battery and Micro USB port. The machined aluminum shell is unfinished (i.e. no anodization or paint). It works fine as is but does show wear VERY easily and thus does already have quite a few scratches. It's usuable as-is, but I'd recommend getting it painted or anodized. Has a new plastic lens. Most glass lenses don't seem to fit properly as the tolerances are a bit tight.
