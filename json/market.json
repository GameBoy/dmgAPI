Comes with the Makho battery. This console has only been used for around 4 hours but I can put new tact switches on if needed.\n\n**-IPS modded GBP** (ice blue shell, white buttons, famitsu lens) - £115. It has a power cleaner mod which seemed necessary to make the screen work with the AAA batteries. If you don't like the shell or buttons, I'm happy to swap for something else if I have it.\n\n**-IPS modded GBC**(white shell with extremerate chameleon buttons) - £140 - again I have other shells/buttons if you don't like this one.\n\n**-Stock GBC** - £60 - no mods, but they will be thoroughly cleaned and if you want I can replace the stock lens with a new glass one.\n\n\n--------\n\nI checked ebay and etsy for the prices of some of these, and where I couldnt find good sold examples I just went by how much it cost to build - so if I'm way off PLEASE let me know.\n\nPostage - I'm willing to post worldwide. I'm also willing to go half on the price of postage as long as it's not crazy.",
