SMD or through hole. \nDifficulties will be initial theory of pros/cons of available SMD vs through Stero jacks, blancing strength of mounting and maintaining clearance for housing. \n\nIDEAL TURNAROUND/completion timeline: 3-4 months \n\nCOMPENSATION: Upon agreement of project, usage terms, and payment rate, designer is guarenteed payment for initial consult and will be provided sample batches of headphone jacks for R&D.¬† Further compensation depends on usage terms. \n\nUSAGE TERMS:\nFree Use / Fulltime Open Community\n- ONLY initial consult donation and supplied R&D materials (headphone jacks). No deadline. \n\nTemporary Sponsor Exclusivity Followed by Free Use \n- Initial Consult, full R&D, and two additional labor payments to be made durring R&D and upon completion. Soft deadline of 3 months, hard deadline of 4 months. \n\nINTEREST: \n- D/M me expressing interest. \n- include link(s) to some of your example pcb works. \n- include your personal time-estimate for project completion once components are materials are delivered\n- Indicate the usage terms you'd prefer, and if applicable desired project commission (minus initial consult.)",
