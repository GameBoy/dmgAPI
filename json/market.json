I'm looking to trade this for a BDSP Limited Edition Switch Lite in New condition.  I have the original packaging for this Lite and can toss it in, if wanted.  Does not come with a charger. (RGRS has the BDSP Switch Lite for sale for $299.  You could buy that and swap with me, if interested)~~\n\n<:WTT:711683426469544006> <:WTS:708489317168971778> GBHD Advance Consolizer fully assembled, tested, and ready to play!  Asking for $265 shipped in the continental US Only.\n\nPlease note, consolizers have compatibility issues with TVs, monitors, and capture cards. Iâ€™m willing to accept returns on this if it doesn't work with your setup. If it doesn't work, and you'd like to return it, you will be responsible for the return shipping cost. It will need to be received in the same condition it was sent.\n\n<:WTT:711683426469544006> <:WTS:708489317168971778> PokÃ©mon Crystal: $95  Received this one from someone who said it wasn't being read by their Game Boy. I inspected it and found a rotted-out trace on the back of the board. I repaired the trace and the neighboring via and sealed everything with solder mask. Please refer to the photos for the repair. The game was also missing a label, so I used one of the super cool clear labels from Next Stop Please.\n\nIf interested in trades; I'm looking for that BDSP Lite.  I'm also looking for PokÃ©mon Pearl (DS) CIB, PokÃ©mon Black, and PokÃ©mon Black 2.\n\nGallery of photos here: https://imgur.com/a/2waKDU9",
