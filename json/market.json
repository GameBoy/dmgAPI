    "message": "<:WTS:708489317168971778>  üá∫üá∏ Georgia\n\nI have 3 gamecubes that have been modded with the new Picoboot modchip. This allows you to load swiss from a micro sd card plugged into the SP2 port in the bottom using an adapter. I modded these consoles myself and have pics of what the mod work in one of them looks like.\n\nI was looking for $140 shipped each. These are console + SD2SP2 adapter (micro sd not included), but I can probably include a basic AV cable if wanted. I have a box full of them, but I don't know if I have extra AC power cables.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/SpOwZVZ\n\n* Gamecube 1 Black - This one has a few body scratches throughout and a slightly yellowed controller port area. One of the memory card flaps is very yellowed. Does not include cover for SP2 slot on the bottom.\n\n* Gamecube 2 Indigo - This one was purchased from GameStop a few years ago. Their refurbishment process looks to have involved sanding the entire shell, as there is some obvious signs that it has been sanded around the body and the top jewel is cloudy now because of it. There is some discoloration of the indigo on the bottom part of the shell. Controller port area is also yellowed.\n\n* Gamecube 3 Indigo - Some general scuffs from age, discolored throughout. The indigo is a bit darker throughout than its supposed to be, but I don't know how well that came out in the pics. I think the controller port area looks pretty good, but I think the memory card flaps are slightly yellowed. This one has a Xeno GC installed, but I couldn't get it to boot backup discs reliably. It boots my PAL and JAP original discs fine though.\n\nAll 3 consoles appear to have working disc drives, but I can't guarantee that they will work reliably due to the age of these consoles and I haven't replaced the lasers on these units. They have booted my discs reliably up to this point but ymmv. This may be a moot point though as the PicoBoot mod will allow backups to be booted from a micro sd card through swiss.",

Bought these parts for my slate build but decided to go with a different theme - so they're opened and handled but really not used at all. Never screwed together. Feel free to offer trades üôÇ",
