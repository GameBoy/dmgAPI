No deadline. \n\nTemporary Sponsor Exclusivity Followed by Free Use \n- Initial Consult, full R&D, and two additional labor payments to be made durring R&D and upon completion. Soft deadline of 3 months, hard deadline of 4 months. \n\nINTEREST: \n- D/M me expressing interest. \n- include link(s) to some of your example pcb works. \n- include your personal time-estimate for project completion once components are materials are delivered\n- Indicate the usage terms you'd prefer, and if applicable desired project commission (minus initial consult.)",
