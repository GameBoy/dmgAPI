Big thanks to all who purchased one (or two!) and supported me.\n\nThat being said, I still have these two shells left (Blink and Flamin' Hot). I have had several people call dibs and then back out, so I'm re-listing them here in hopes that they move. It's a bit tricky to photograph the clear plastic, but be assured that they are vibrant and juicy in person! \n\nI've decided to drop the price down to $40 each - I would really like these off my desk so that I can start work on another batch! First come first serve.\nAll shells come with hardware, buttons and membranes!\n\n- ~~Blink (pink/blue fade): $40 + shipping~~ SOLD\n- Flamin' Hot (orange/yellow fade) $40 + shipping\n\nThank you all very much! Looking forward to seeing these with guts in 'em!\n\n******EDIT: Please ignore the bottom right picture, that's a different shell that is already sold! My bad! Darn computers...",

No stickers on the back. I believe it has the v2 freckleshack kit, see https://gameboy.github.io/wiki/backlightmods#cgb if you don't know what that is. The screen is installed with shims, and is not permanently adhered. The brightness control is installed, hold select to slowly cycle through the brightness levels. It has a replacement speaker installed. The two center screw posts appear to be splitting a bit, so be careful if you take it apart. Plays great!\n\n\n**DMG-style GBP with FP Q5 screen - $95 shipped US**\n\nAuthentic shell, in awesome shape! Battery cover is aftermarket, but a very good match. The lens is OEM, with some minor scratches/scuffs. This has the funnyplaying q5 pocket kit installed, with the palette touch sensor in the top right corner. The screen is not adhered, and is shimmed. There is some dust/smudging between the screen and lens, because I have swapped the screen out a few times and frankly haven't been super careful. As is, it plays great, but you might notice a speck or smudge. Would be a relatively easy fix to clean everything up and stick the screen down if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nMore pics - https://imgur.com/a/TimAKJG\n\nPotentially open to trade if you can make an interesting offer, interested in boktai, drill dozer, warioware twisted, other gb(a) games. Most games with unique hardware. OEM link cables",
