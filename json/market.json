Big thanks to all who purchased one (or two!) and supported me.\n\nThat being said, I still have these two shells left (Blink and Flamin' Hot). I have had several people call dibs and then back out, so I'm re-listing them here in hopes that they move. It's a bit tricky to photograph the clear plastic, but be assured that they are vibrant and juicy in person! \n\nI've decided to drop the price down to $40 each - I would really like these off my desk so that I can start work on another batch! First come first serve.\nAll shells come with hardware, buttons and membranes!\n\n- ~~Blink (pink/blue fade): $40 + shipping~~ SOLD\n- Flamin' Hot (orange/yellow fade) $40 + shipping\n\nThank you all very much! Looking forward to seeing these with guts in 'em!\n\n******EDIT: Please ignore the bottom right picture, that's a different shell that is already sold! My bad! Darn computers...",
