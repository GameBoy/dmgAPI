Â£300. Comes with the Makho battery. This console has only been used for around 4 hours but I can put new tact switches on if needed.\n\n**-IPS modded GBP** (ice blue shell, white buttons, famitsu lens) - Â£115. It has a power cleaner mod which seemed necessary to make the screen work with the AAA batteries. If you don't like the shell or buttons, I'm happy to swap for something else if I have it.\n\n**-IPS modded GBC**(white shell with extremerate chameleon buttons) - Â£140 - again I have other shells/buttons if you don't like this one.\n\n**-Stock GBC** - Â£60 - no mods, but they will be thoroughly cleaned and if you want I can replace the stock lens with a new glass one.\n\n\n--------\n\nI checked ebay and etsy for the prices of some of these, and where I couldnt find good sold examples I just went by how much it cost to build - so if I'm way off PLEASE let me know.\n\nPostage - I'm willing to post worldwide. I'm also willing to go half on the price of postage as long as it's not crazy.",

Speaker quiet at max volume.\n\n#13 - Powers on, but has dead pixels in the center. Has some weird hardened white gunk on the exterior back? I took a few passes at cleaning it, but looks/feels like hardened lotion. Very odd.\n\n~~#14 - Turns on, works like a normal MGB. The backplate is green, and the glass screen has lost all adhesiveness.~~ SOLD\n\n#18 - Powers on, screen burnt in. I think someone fingerpainted on the glass as well?\n\n#23 - Powers on, screen burnt in.\n\n#26 - Powers on, screen burnt in. Noticed a little corrosion on the battery terminals on the shell side. No backplate.\n\n~~#27 - Powers on  most of the time. May need some cleaning. No backplate.~~ SOLD\n\n~~#29 -  Fully functional. Covered in dragonquest stickers, if you're into that. *on hold*~~ SOLD\n\nHappy to go into more details of these over DM's - Asking $30 + shipping per. I may also have some spare parts, just ask.",
